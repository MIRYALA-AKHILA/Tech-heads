                <h4>About us</h4>
                <h2>A Small Community </h2>
                <p>Hair is an important part of our looks & the way we project ourselves to the 
                    world. Hair is precious and even more so to someone who loses it suddenly due 
                    to medical reasons. For cancer patients, hair loss is the most stressful & traumatic
                     side effect of chemotherapy and radiation treatment. This effect on their appearance
                      can be a further setback to patients who are already enduring physical and emotional hardship. 
                      The patients lose their identity, lack self-esteem and have lowered morale. So we a small group
                       of people who want to show the support at least by suppling the hair from people to the patients
                        . We Hair Donars will collect your hair at your doorsteps and help them reach cancer patients.
                        provides wigs for people who have experienced hair loss from the treatment of any form of cancer.
                         Their minimum length is less than some other organizations at 8 inches. Hair may be colored with
                          vegetable dyes, rinses, or semi-permanent dyes, but not permanent dyes or bleaches Please show your
                           support by donating now !
